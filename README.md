## About The Project



Assessing Car Damage with Convolutional Neural Networks
Created a webapp which can be used in the process of the personal auto claims process with computer vision and deep learning. Identifying damage location and severity with accuracies of 77% and 71% respectively, using transfer learning on VGG16. Deployed web app with Flask and Bootstrap for real-time car damage evaluations. 
## Built With

OPENCV

TENSORFLOW

FLASK

## Application

Perhaps the most common damage to a car, is damage that comes from an accident or a collision. Auto body techs see their fair share of dented bumpers, crushed hoods and even rear ends that are unrecognizable. Even when an accident occurs at a relatively slow speeds, lots of damage can happen to a car.
This webapp uses CNN to detect those damages and tells a user whether the damage that has been done is minor or moderate or a crirtical one and also tells us from which side the vehicle is damaged
